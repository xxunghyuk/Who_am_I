# 🍎 Sunghyuk Yoon — Cover Letter (Creative Edition)

This is my creative cover letter for the **Product Design FEA Team** at Apple, written not as a traditional document, but as a Swift-style structure that reflects how I think: systems-first, iteration-driven, and always curious.

### Why Code?
Because I believe **how** you present your story can be just as meaningful as the story itself—especially when applying to a company that values both design and engineering.

### What's in here?
- `CoverLetter.swift` – a playful summary of my journey from music to machine learning, with a deep respect for systems, iteration, and Apple’s design philosophy.

### Want the formal version?
You’ll find it in my application—but this is the one I hope makes you smile.

Thanks for visiting!
